We live in a new world. With increased global Internet connectivity and a large-scale transition from physical to information-based labor, new paradigms must emerge if organizations are to adapt to this new landscape. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, but GOSPEL recognizes the potential to radically optimize work flows to this new environment. If traditional, non-Internet-native, geography-based work is a single-core processor, this document attempts to lay out a specification for a distributed system. The Internet does not completely overturn the old principles governing how organizations operate. However, it should cause an operator to make different choises and sacrifices after taking the big picture into consideration. This allows them to take advantage of the massive increase in output that a distributed system can bring.
