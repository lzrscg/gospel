# Global Open Source Permissionless Enterprise League (GOSPEL)

> This document is a work-in-progress. The ideas are presented authoritatively, however, they may not work for everyone. Pull requests and feedback are welcome. If you believe in the GOSPEL's mission, please contribute your findings.

We live in a new world. With increased global Internet connectivity and a large-scale transition from physical to information-based labor, new paradigms must emerge if organizations are to adapt to this new landscape. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, but GOSPEL recognizes the potential to radically optimize work flows to this new environment. If traditional, non-Internet-native, geography-based work is a single-core processor, this document attempts to lay out a specification for a distributed system. The Internet does not completely overturn the old principles governing how organizations operate. However, it should cause an operator to make different choices and sacrifices after taking the big picture into consideration. This allows them to take advantage of the massive increase in output that a distributed system can bring.

## In a nutshell
GOSPEL is targeted at commercial enterprises, particularly those in tech. Many non-profit projects (i.e. FOSS) already adopt many of these ideas, but lack funding and a sustainable leadership model. While there is room for innovation in non-profit funding and governance, GOSPEL does not attempt to address these problems. Instead, it focuses on helping commercial enterprises operate in an Internet-native manner.

GOSPEL has three tenets, each with many implications.
* **Collaborate globally** - communicate in long-form writing and execute asynchronously to enable collaboration across geographies.
* **Open source everything** - make as much source code, internal communications, and business strategy public as possible. Some things may need to be proprietary, but that should be the exception and not the norm.
* **Optimize for permissionless contributions** - since everything is open source and globally optimized, allow anyone in the world read the source code or business strategy and get paid to submit their contribution. Contributors may still be able to opt for salaried employment.

These three tenets work in concert to provide enterprises with certain benefits:
* **Better talent.** 
  * Opening up to the global talent market increases the amount of available highly skilled labor by orders of magnitude. Allowing permissionless contributions enbables an organization to hire from a larger pool without the added friction of navigating foreign labor markets.
  * _The purpose of hiring globally is to more easily access highly skilled labor, not to cut costs._ 
  * Permissionless contributions give work opportunities based on merit to people excluded from traditional recruitment processes. This will allow an enterprise to utilized underrated talent.
  * Global work flows are more flexible and, given the choice, top talent might prefer a workplace that offers one over a workplace that does not.
* **A more robust organization.** 
  * Global collaboration via long-form written communication extracts specific domain knowledge out of the heads of individuals and small teams and places it into version control. 
  * Problems are often detected earlier in open source projects because there are more eyes on it.
  * Optimizing for permissionless contributions makes it easier to replace lost personelle.
* **Becoming a nexus of the industry.**
  * Making source code, internal communications, and business strategy public builds good will among customers and the community.
  * Sharing implementation and execution details attracts talent when they are trying to learn.
  * An organization is constantly creating internal content, but wasting opportunities to use it as content marketing because it is confidential.
* **The potentional to attain "workforce autoscaling"; by simply paying more, a workforce can be blitzscaled with few bottlenecks.**
