# Global Open Source Permissionless Enterprise League (GOSPEL)

> This document is a work-in-progress. The ideas are presented authoritatively, however, they may not work for everyone. Pull requests and feedback are welcome. If you believe in the GOSPEL's mission, please contribute your findings.

We live in a new world. With increased global Internet connectivity and a large-scale transition from physical to information-based labor, new paradigms must emerge if organizations are to adapt to this new landscape. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, but GOSPEL recognizes the potential to radically optimize work flows to this new environment. If traditional, non-Internet-native, geography-based work is a single-core processor, this document attempts to lay out a specification for a distributed system. The Internet does not completely overturn the old principles governing how organizations operate. However, it should cause an operator to make different choices and sacrifices after taking the big picture into consideration. This allows them to take advantage of the massive increase in output that a distributed system can bring.

**About the Author:** LZRS is a software developer with experience:
* Managing community contributions and working as an engineer at a prominent cryptocurrency company
* Founding a startup with cofounders and employees in radically different timezones and countries
* Most recently, building software supporting COVID-19 immunization and working as a tech lead at one of the world's largest vaccine distributors

LZRS has been greatly inspired by some personal friends who have had success building global workforces, as well as the thought leadership of Balaji Srinivasan.

## In a nutshell
GOSPEL is targeted at commercial tech enterprises and has three tenets.
1. **Optimize for global collaboration**
    * Communicate via long-form writing.
    * Execute asynchronously.
2. **Open source everything**
    * Make source code, internal communications, and business strategy public.
    * Some things may need to be proprietary, but that should be the exception and not the norm.
3. **Enable permissionless contributions**
    * Since everything is open source and globally optimized, allow anyone in the world read the source code or business strategy and get paid to contribute (i.e. fixing a bug in the app).
    * Contributors may still be able to opt for salaried employment.

These three tenets work in concert to provide enterprises with certain benefits:
* **Better talent.** 
  * _The purpose of hiring globally is to access a larger pool of highly skilled labor, not to cut costs._ 
  * Permissionless contributions enable enterprises to tap into the global talent pool without experiencing the significant friction of navigating foreign labor markets.
  * Contributors can be pseudonymous and are compensated based on merit. This provides opportunities to those excluded from the traditional hiring process and allows enterprises to utilize underrated talent.
  * Top talent often prefers the flexibility of remote, asynchronous work.
* **A more robust organization.** 
  * Long-form written communication extracts important information out of the heads of individuals and small teams, and places it into version control. 
  * Problems are often detected earlier in open source projects because there are more eyes on them.
  * Optimizing for permissionless contributions makes it easier to replace lost personelle.
* **Becoming a nexus of industry.**
  * Transparency builds good will among customers and the community.
  * Sharing implementation and execution details attracts talent when they are trying to learn.
  * An enterprise is constantly creating internal content, but wasting valuable opportunities to use it for content marketing due to unnecessary confidentiality.
* **The potentional to attain "workforce autoscaling"; by simply paying more, a workforce can be blitzscaled with few bottlenecks.**

## The playbook

This playbook is for tech company operators. It expores specific considations that must be taken into account when enacting the three tenets.

### Levels of contribution
Permissionless contributions come in at least three levels.
1. **Task delegation**
    * A contributor completes a task according to its specification.
    * _Example:_ adding a well-specified feature to an app.
2. **(Technical) product management**
    * A contributor specifies a task guided by a strategy.
    * _Example:_ designing the specification for the feature mentioned above.
3. **Strategy**
    * A contributor lays out the direction that guides another strategy or the specification of a task. This can be at an arbitrarily high level. There can be a strategy that guides a sub-strategy that inspires a feature specification. 
    * _Example:_ creating the roadmap that indicates the need for the feature specification mentioned above.

As the levels increase, the operator's mindset must change from that of a bureaucratic manager to that of an asset allocator. The operator has capital to spend and must invest in a portfolio of features and strategies, each with their own execution risk. 

This playbook is built from real experience, therefore it primarily discusses level 1 contributions. However, one goal of GOSPEL is to explore these higher-order contributions. If you have experience with this, please consider contributing your findings.

### Decide and commit
The operator enacting this playbook is a pioneer.
